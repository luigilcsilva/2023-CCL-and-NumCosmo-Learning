# CCL-and-NumCosmo-Learning
This is a repository to save some notebooks related to my initial study of CCL and NumCosmo libraries. These notebooks were created around the first semester of 2023. The final notebooks, used in my Master's Thesis, aren't available online yet. The expectation is that they will be available in the next weeks in the NumCosmo main repository (https://github.com/NumCosmo/NumCosmo).
